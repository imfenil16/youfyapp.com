            <h2>Am I required to pay to use any feature of the extension?</h2>
            <p>No, our extension is completely free to use.</p>

            <h2>Do I need to provide any personal information?</h2>
            <p>
              No, we do not store or ask for any personal information from our
              users. The only requirement is for users to log in to their
              Spotify account.

            <h2>Can I transfer any type of playlist?</h2>
            <p>
              Since we donâ€™t require users to log in to their YouTube account,
              users can only transfer public and unlisted playlists. If you wish
              to transfer a private playlist, we suggest making it public or
              unlisted beforehand.

            <h2>Does this extension support platforms other than Spotify?</h2>
            <p>
              Currently, our extension can open songs on different platforms
              like Apple Music and Amazon Music. We do not support song transfer
              functionality for other platforms yet.

            <h2>How many songs can I transfer at once?</h2>
            <p>
              Currently, our extension allows up to 50 songs per playlist to be
              transferred at once. This number might increase in the near
              future.
